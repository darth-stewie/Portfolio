# Objective

The implementation of comprehensive solutions for QA teams to ensure a highly functional product through the use of:

* Automated Testing
  * End-to-end functional regression in addition to Load, API, and performance
* Manual Testing
  * Functional, API, bug reproductions, exploratory testing
* Internal toolset engineering
  * Improving team efficiency through R&D of daily tasks and communication methods
* Expert documentation and collaboration

## Background

With 5+ years of experience in QA, I can provide low-cost, practical solutions for the automated testing of web and native applications in addition to excellent manual testing efforts. With a focus on growth, innovation, and collaboration, my diligence and expertise can help ensure a high quality product for your company.

### Experience

#### Examples of my work

* **Automation**: In a single quarter, caught 5 high-impact bugs during pre-deployment ( saving thousands of dollars in repairs and support calls )
* **Automation**: Built multiple end-to-end regression test suites with 100+ scenarios, _each_ ( improving QA efficiency )
* **Manual**: Caught multiple bugs in new-feature deployments that would have negatively affected hundreds of clients ( ensuring client retention )
* **Documentation**: Wrote hundreds of heavily detailed bug/story/task tickets in Jira and many SOPs using Confluence ( saving $ in the reduction of calls/meetings )
* **Engineering**: Researched and developed low-cost performance and load testing projects ( bringing awareness to developers and stakeholders )

#### Portfolio

**E2E Load Test**
Uses AWS Lambda & S3 with Google Apps Script to put a load of virtual users onto the application, following pre-defined paths. Reporting handled and generated using Google Apps Script.

* Allows for low-cost evaluation of web application performance over large sample sets
* Enables stakeholders to maintain confidence in the application
* Provides visibility to developers about large-scale effects of new changes

**E2E Automated Regression test suite**
Uses Cypress.io + Typescript w/ Cucumber, for a web application. 100+ test cases with scenarios using a POM ( Page Object Model ) style.

* Utilizes built-in Chai library from Cypress, with custom commands to handle bulk assertions. Allows for multi-value asserting capabilities and even allows the user to check/throw only when subsequent command is invoked
* Page selectors are dynamically influenced from arguments passed to their parent function
* Makes use of a custom HTML reporting mechanism for local-only documentation
* Heavy use of accurate JSDoc comments for types, interfaces, functions, and classes

**E2E Performance Test**
Uses [Loadero](https://loadero.com/), Google Apps Script, Google Drive, and [analyzeRTC](https://app.testrtc.com/app/analyze) in conjunction with an edited version of the E2E load test, to put a load of virtual users onto the application.

* Users are predefined with various hardware, network, and regional configurations
* Logs are parsed into a custom reporting Google Sheet and .dump files are downloaded to marked folders in Drive using Apps Script
* Introspection done with analyzeRTC
